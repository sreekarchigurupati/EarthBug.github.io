Hampi is a UNESCO world heritage site located on the banks of the river Tungabhadra. It is connected with Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Goa through overnight buses and trains. Hampi has a warm, dry climate year-round. Winter (Dec–Feb) is a common time to visit as the weather is cooler. The hot summer (Mar–Jun) is less busy, and is followed by the monsoon season. Day 0 Secunderabad Railway station | Credits: Vinay Narayanan Travel We started from Hyderabad on a friday night aboard the Manuguru - CSMT Kohlapur Express. As is with Indian Railways 😆, the train got delayed by 4 hours. You might lose the first half of your day at Hampi, so plan accordingly. Sleep well as you have to be well rested for the day after. Alternately, you can drive overnight from Hyderabad/Bengaluru. IMPORTANT: reserve tickets at least a month before to avoid hassle Day 1 You’ll arrive at the nearest railway station - Hospete Junction. Hampi is around 12 kilometers from Hospete, You can either choose to take an autorickshaw or board the bus to Hampi from there. Hospete Junction | Credits: Priyanka Raga Stay You’ll arrive in Hampi close to the ancient bazaar and Virupaksha temple, there are lot of homestays here. You can pick any one for cheap with a decent bathroom. We chose one with a view. Luxury options like Hyatt are available at least 30 kilometers away. IMPORTANT: prebook the stay View from homestay Food Good option for breakfast is “Old Chillout”. Their English breakfast and pancakes are top notch. You can play with the kittens and dogs that frequent the place. English breakfast at chillout | Credits: Priyanka Raga The hambs at chillout Lunch and dinner is really nice at “Mango Tree”.

It is connected with Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Goa through overnight buses and trains. Hampi has a warm, dry climate year-round. Winter (Dec–Feb) is a common time to visit as the weather is cooler. The hot summer (Mar–Jun) is less busy, and is followed by the monsoon season.</p> <h2 id="day-0">Day 0</h2> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/secbad-train.jpg" alt="Secunderabad Railway station" width="300px" /></p> <p><em>Secunderabad Railway station | Credits: Vinay Narayanan</em></p> <h3 id="travel">Travel</h3> <p>We started from Hyderabad on a friday night aboard the Manuguru - CSMT Kohlapur Express. As is with Indian Railways 😆, the train got delayed by <strong>4 hours</strong>. You might lose the first half of your day at Hampi, so plan accordingly. Sleep well as you have to be well rested for the day after. Alternately, you can drive overnight from Hyderabad/Bengaluru.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: reserve tickets at least a month before to avoid hassle</strong></p> <h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2> <p>You’ll arrive at the nearest railway station - Hospete Junction. Hampi is around 12 kilometers from Hospete, You can either choose to take an autorickshaw or board the bus to Hampi from there.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/hospete-jn.jpg" alt="Hospete Junction" /> <em>Hospete Junction | Credits: Priyanka Raga</em></p> <h3 id="stay">Stay</h3> <p>You’ll arrive in Hampi close to the ancient bazaar and Virupaksha temple, there are lot of homestays here. You can pick any one for cheap with a decent bathroom. We chose one with a view. Luxury options like Hyatt are available at least 30 kilometers away.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: prebook the stay</strong></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/homestay-view.jpg" alt="Homestay view" /> <em>View from homestay</em></p> <h3 id="food">Food</h3> <p>Good option for breakfast is “Old Chillout”. Their English breakfast and pancakes are top notch. You can play with the kittens and dogs that frequent the place.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/breakfast.jpg" alt="Chillout" /></p> <p><em>English breakfast at chillout | Credits: Priyanka Raga</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/chillout-cats.jpg" alt="Kittens" /> <em>The hambs at chillout</em></p> <p>Lunch and dinner is really nice at “Mango Tree”. They have various cuisines and comfortable floor-deewan style seating.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/mangotree.jpg" alt="Mango Tree" /> <em>Mango Tree | Credits: Vinay Narayanan</em></p> <p>There are lot of other options around if you want to explore.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Non-vegetarian food is prohibited in the ruins area, so stick to veg or eggs. Too much craving?? Travel outside the ruins area to find places that serve meat</strong></p> <h3 id="start-your-adventure">Start your adventure</h3> <h4 id="durga-temple">Durga Temple</h4> <p>Start in an auto to the Durga temple near Anegundi. There’s a scenic view to experience from the top and few small attractions nearby including a Goshala and a cave.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/durga-temple.jpg" alt="Durga Temple" /> <em>Durga Temple | Credits: Vinay Narayanan</em></p> <h4 id="lakshmi-temple">Lakshmi Temple</h4> <p>Now take an auto to reach the ancient Lakshmi temple in Hanumanahalli. You’ll be greeted by many monkeys and the serene rectangular tank - Pampa Sarovar.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/pampa-sarovar.jpg" alt="Pampa Sarovar" /> <em>Pampa Sarovar | Credits: Vinay Narayanan</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/monkeys.jpg" alt="Monkeys" width="300px" /></p> <p><em>Monkeys at Lakshmi temple | Credits: Vinay Narayanan</em></p> <h4 id="anjanadri">Anjanadri</h4> <p>Now take an auto to reach Anjanadri, the hill on which Hanuman was supposedly born. You’ll have to climb 575 steps to reach the top, but the view it offers is worth the hassle. There’s a temple on top which has a floating rock supposedly from the <em>rama-setu</em>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/anjanadri-view.jpg" alt="Anjanadri View" /> <em>View from atop Anjanadri</em></p> <h4 id="sunset-point">Sunset point</h4> <p>A short hike from the top of Anjanadri-betta on boulders will take you to a spot famous for watching the sun set amidst the tantalizing landscape.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Make sure you reach here some time before the sunset, so you don’t miss the opportunity to chill out and take a timelapse</strong></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/sunset-tree.jpg" alt="Tree" width="300px" /></p> <p><em>Just a tree</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset" /> <em>Sunset point</em></p> <h4 id="virupaksha-temple">Virupaksha Temple</h4> <p>Now rush back in an auto to Virupaksha temple near your homestay. It closes around 8:15PM. If you’re lucky you’ll be blessed by the temple elephant - Lakshmi. The elephant pays homage to the deity and the temple closes for the day. Alternately you can go there in the early hours of the next morning to witness the elephant’s daily bath ritual (you perv 🤬).</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/virupaksha-temple.jpg" alt="Virupaksha Temple" width="300px" /></p> <p><em>Virupaksha Temple | Credits: Vinay Narayanan</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/lakshmi-elephant.jpg" alt="Lakshmi" /> <em>Lakshmi the elephant</em></p> <h3 id="end-of-day">End of day</h3> <p>Have dinner at Mango tree and go to sleep. The first day was mostly hopping between places in an auto. The second day will be completely on moped/cycle. Wake up at least an hour before sunrise the next morning</p> <h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Hire a guide for the full day and ask him to wait outside Achutaraya temple an hour after you start for Mathanga hill</strong></p> <h4 id="mathanga-hill">Mathanga Hill</h4> <p>Walk from you homestay past the bazaar street opposite to Virupaksha temple to reach the Mathanga hill and start climbing to witness the sunrise. Bring along headlight/torches if it’s very dark. Breathe in the view and take some goofy pictures. You’ll find many millipedes along the way.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/millipede.jpg" alt="Millipede" /> <em>Millipede</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/mathanga-view.jpg" alt="Mathanga View" /> <em>Achutaraya temple view from atop Mathanga hill</em></p> <h4 id="achutaraya-temple">Achutaraya Temple</h4> <p>Climb down the Mathanga hill on the other side to enter an intricate temple complex that is the Achutaraya Temple. The Achutaraya temple is an ancient Vaishnavite shrine.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/achutaraya-temple.jpg" alt="Achutaraya Temple" /> <em>Achutaraya Temple</em></p> <p>Like every other major Vijayanagara temple complex, Achutaraya temple has it’s own ancient bazaar street right outside, Meet your guide here.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/achutaraya-bazaar.jpg" alt="Achutaraya Bazaar" /> <em>The bazaar opposite Achutaraya temple</em></p> <p>Start walking towards the Vitthala temple complex. You’ll start seeing a lot of interesting structures along the way, make sure to ask your guide about them.</p> <p>Few of these things are:</p> <p><strong>King’s balance</strong>. This was the place where the annual <em>tulabhara</em> or the weighting of the king against riches and grain used to take place. The riches and grain are then distributed among the poor.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/kings-balance.jpg" alt="King's balance" /></p> <p><em>King’s Balance</em></p> <p><strong>Temple Barracks</strong>. These were used by the soldiers protecting the temple.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/temple-barracks.jpg" alt="Temple Barracks" /></p> <p><em>Temple Barracks</em></p> <p>And there are a lot of <strong>Mantapas</strong> (Open walled structures)</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/mantapa.jpg" alt="Mantapa" /></p> <p><em>Mantapa</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/krishnadevaraya-carving.jpg" alt="Krishnadevaraya" /></p> <p><em>Krishnadevaraya and his two wives</em></p> <p>There’s a temple with <em>Varaha</em> seal on both sides of the entry gate on the way to Vitthala temple.</p> <p>You’ll reach the Vitthala temple complex after a short walk.</p> <h4 id="vitthala-temple">Vitthala Temple</h4> <p>Vitthala Temple is a 15<sup>th</sup> century temple dedicated to Vitthala-Vishnu. It has many attractions including the famous stone-chariot featured on the Rs. 50 note, musical pillars inside the <em>Ranga Mandapa</em>, Marriage hall and Ramayana carvings.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/vithala-temple.jpg" alt="Vitthala Temple" /></p> <p><em>Vitthala Temple</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/stone-chariot.jpg" alt="Stone Chariot" /></p> <p><em>Stone chariot</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/musical-pillars.jpg" alt="Musical Pillars" /></p> <p><em>Musical Pillars</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/inside-mantapa.jpg" alt="Mantapa" /></p> <p><em>One of the many mantapas inside Vitthala temple</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/ramayana-carvings.jpg" alt="Ramayana Carvings" /></p> <p><em>Carvings depicting the stories in Ramayana</em></p> <p>After coming out of Vitthala temple, start walking back along the bank of river <em>Tungabhadra</em>.</p> <p>You’ll see a small structure along the bank. This is the <strong>Purandaradasa Mantapa</strong> in which the great poet Purandaradasa who composed more than 75,000 classical compositions sat and composed his songs.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/purandaradasa-mantapa.jpg" alt="Purandaradasa Mantapa" /></p> <p><em>Purandaradasa Mantapa at a distance</em></p> <p>Keep walking and you’ll come to <strong>Kodandarama Temple</strong>. Here you can find coracle boat rides, if you’re up for it. Keep walking onto Hampi Baazar Street and then your homestay.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/kodandarama-temple.jpg" alt="Kodandarama Temple" /></p> <p><em>Kodandarama Temple</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/coracle-ride.jpg" alt="Coracle point" /></p> <p><em>Coracle point</em></p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Have breakfast now and check out of the homestay if you’re only staying for 2 days as you’ll not be needing the room anymore and can avoid another day’s charge</strong></p> <p>Go hire bicycles/mopeds now. They’ll be located very close to the homestays.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Don’t forget to take locks from the vendor and lock your cycle whenever you’re leaving it outside</strong></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/bicycles.jpg" alt="Bicycles" /></p> <p><em>Bicycles</em></p> <p>Your guide will be going on their motorcycle from monument to monument, just follow them.</p> <h4 id="hemakuta-group-of-temples-and-kadalekalu-ganesha">Hemakuta group of temples and Kadalekalu Ganesha</h4> <p>There’s a monolithic statue of ganesha that was commisioned in the Vijayanagara era by a peanut merchant.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/kadalekalu-ganesha.jpg" alt="Kadalekalu Ganesha" /></p> <p><em>Kadalekalu Ganesha</em></p> <h4 id="badavilinga-temple">Badavilinga temple</h4> <p>A shivalinga surrounded by water from a canal commisioned in the Vijayanagara era by a poor woman.</p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/badavilinga.jpg" alt="Badavilinga" /></p> <p><em>Badavilinga Temple</em></p> <p><img src="/assets/imgs/posts/hampi-travelogue/path.jpg" alt="Path" /></p> <p><em>Path across the monuments | Credits: Priyanka Raga</em></p> <h4 id="underground-shiva-temple">Underground Shiva Temple</h4> <p>A shiva temple built below ground level, the main sanctum remains flooded with water in monsoon.
