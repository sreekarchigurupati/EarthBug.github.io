## What's this
This is a rough guide to plan your weekend trip to Hampi.

Hampi is a UNESCO world heritage site located on the banks of the river Tungabhadra. It is connected with Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Goa through overnight buses and trains. Hampi has a warm, dry climate year-round. Winter (Dec–Feb) is a common time to visit as the weather is cooler. The hot summer (Mar–Jun) is less busy, and is followed by the monsoon season.

## Day 0

### Travel 
We started from Hyderabad on a friday night aboard the Manuguru - CSMT Kohlapur Express. As is with Indian Railways 😆, the train got delayed by **4 hours**. You might lose the first half of your day at Hampi, so plan accordingly. Sleep well as you have to be well rested for the day after. Alternately, you can drive overnight from Hyderabad/Bengaluru.

**IMPORTANT: reserve tickets at least a month before to avoid hassle**

## Day 1

You'll arrive at the nearest railway station - Hospete Junction. Hampi is around 12 kilometers from Hospete, You can either choose to take an autorickshaw or board the bus to Hampi from there.

### Stay

You'll arrive in Hampi close to the ancient bazaar and Virupaksha temple, there are lot of homestays here. You can pick any one for cheap with a decent bathroom. We chose one with a view. Luxury options like Hyatt are available at least 30 kilometers away.

**IMPORTANT: prebook the stay**

There are lot of other options around if you want to explore.

**IMPORTANT: Non-vegetarian food is prohibited in the ruins area, so stick to veg or eggs. Too much craving?? Travel outside the ruins area to find places that serve meat**

### Start your adventure

#### Durga Temple
Start in an auto to the Durga temple near Anegundi. There's a scenic view to experience from the top and few small attractions nearby including a Goshala and a cave.

#### Anjanadri
Now take an auto to reach Anjanadri, the hill on which Hanuman was supposedly born. You'll have to climb 575 steps to reach the top, but the view it offers is worth the hassle. There's a temple on top which has a floating rock supposedly from the *rama-setu*.

![Anjanadri View](/assets/hampi-travelogue/anjanadri-view.jpg)
*View from atop Anjanadri*

#### Sunset point
A short hike from the top of Anjanadri-betta on boulders will take you to a spot famous for watching the sun set amidst the tantalizing landscape.

**IMPORTANT: Make sure you reach here some time before the sunset, so you don't miss the opportunity to chill out and take a timelapse**

#### Virupaksha Temple
Now rush back in an auto to Virupaksha temple near your homestay. It closes around 8:15PM. If you're lucky you'll be blessed by the temple elephant - Lakshmi. The elephant pays homage to the deity and the temple closes for the day. Alternately you can go there in the early hours of the next morning to witness the elephant's daily bath ritual (you perv 🤬).
