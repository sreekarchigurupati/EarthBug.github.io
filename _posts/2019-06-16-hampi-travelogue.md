## What's this
This is a rough guide to plan your weekend trip to Hampi.

Hampi is a UNESCO world heritage site located on the banks of the river Tungabhadra. It is connected with Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Goa through overnight buses and trains. Hampi has a warm, dry climate year-round. Winter (Decâ€“Feb) is a common time to visit as the weather is cooler. The hot summer (Marâ€“Jun) is less busy, and is followed by the monsoon season.

### Travel 
We started from Hyderabad on a friday night aboard the Manuguru - CSMT Kohlapur Express. As is with Indian Railways ðŸ˜†, the train got delayed by **4 hours**. You might lose the first half of your day at Hampi, so plan accordingly. Sleep well as you have to be well rested for the day after. Alternately, you can drive overnight from Hyderabad/Bengaluru.

**IMPORTANT: reserve tickets at least a month before to avoid hassle**

## Day 1

You'll arrive at the nearest railway station - Hospete Junction. Hampi is around 12 kilometers from Hospete, You can either choose to take an autorickshaw or board the bus to Hampi from there.

### Stay

You'll arrive in Hampi close to the ancient bazaar and Virupaksha temple, there are lot of homestays here. You can pick any one for cheap with a decent bathroom. We chose one with a view. Luxury options like Hyatt are available at least 30 kilometers away.

**IMPORTANT: prebook the stay**

#### Sunset point
