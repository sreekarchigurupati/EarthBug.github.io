*Charminar on a busy evening*

## Introduction
The [Charminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charminar){:target="_blank"} (lit. "four minarets") is a monument located in Hyderabad. It's recognised globally as a symbol of Hyderabad and it's culture. Built at the centre of the city originally to commemorate it's foundation (and also to mark the eradication of a cholera epidemic), Charminar now stands centered in the hussle-bustle of the "Old City" and it's vibrant society.

The [Deccani cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabadi_cuisine){:target="_blank"} is variant and doesn't suffer from a lack of variety. There are many dishes which can be said to represent the cuisine and locals will start a tempestuous argument upon the exclusion of any such dish from the Dastarkhān. This article doesn't intend to provide a list of the most authentic or representative dishes. It is a collection of my food experiences around Charminar in a format possible to conclude in a single visit and also gives an opportunity to see some of the monuments around. A heritage walk and a menu dégustation combined, if you will.

## Travel
There is no provision for four-wheeler parking anywhere close to Charminar. The parking for two-wheelers is also sketchy and you will end up parking in some by-lane nearby. You can take a metro to the MGBS metro station and walk from there. The suggestion is to reach the neighbourhood by two-wheeler or by public transport. You will have to walk between places, so be ready to walk around 10 kilometers throughout the day. The pedestrianisation of the immediate vicinity of Charminar also makes it impossible to complete the entire trip on a vehicle.

## The first stop - Munshi Naan
![Char Koni Naan being packed at Munshi Naan](/assets/charminar-food-tour/munshi-naan.jpg)
*Char Koni Naan being packed at Munshi Naan*

Founded in 1851 by Mohammed Hussain Saheb, who worked as a Munshi(Persian word for contractor/secretary) in an office under the fourth Nizam of Hyderabad, This shop arguably serves the best Naan around town. He learnt making the Naan on a visit to Delhi. The shop is situated in the Purani Haveli area, the operation goes on oblivious to the traffic around. There are many other shops with the same name, but the one in Purani Haveli is the authentic one.

Get a Char Koni Naan (lit. "four cornered bread") per person packed from Munshi Naan and head to the next destination. 


## Chai and biscuits - Nimrah Cafe & Bakery

*View of Charminar Kaman from atop the Charminar*

If you head south from Munshi Naan down the Mir Alam Mandi road and take a right into the Kali Kaman road and go past Kali Kaman, you'll arrive at the historical fountain "Gulzar Houz" built 400 years ago. From this place, the [Char Kaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_Kaman){:target="_blank"}(lit. four gateway/arches) are visible, The east kaman which we just crossed - Kali Kaman, the western one called the “Kaman-e-Sehar-Batil” (lit. "the arch of the magic breaker"), the northern one called Machli Kaman(lit. "arch with a fish") and the southern one - Charminar Kaman is visible along with a view of the Charminar itself. In the olden days, A big fish made of bamboo and paper was left hanging at Machli Kaman on the lunar new year, hence the name. Initially called the “Kaman-e-Sehar-Batil” (lit. "The arch of the magic breaker"), the name is now corrupted to "Sher-e-Batil". It was a gateway that lead to an area that housed lot of royal palaces extending up to the river Musi, these palaces no longer exist. Mir Momin (The planner of Hyderabad & then Peshwa) erected a large stone pillar to its side and inscribed verses to ward of evil spirits. That's how the name came to be. Continue from Gulzar House towards and past Charminar to find Nimrah Cafe & Bakery.

*Refreshing Chai and biscuit platter at Nimrah*

Nimrah opened in 1993 and is one the original Irani cafes in the city. It opens early in the morning and serves authentic Irani Chai and biscuits throughout the day. Order an Irani Chai and an assorted platter of biscuits(and Osmania biscuits for tasting their speciality). They also serve butter buns, Dil Khush, milk & fruit breads and bake new stock once every half an hour. They have varieties in Chai too for personal preference - Pauna (Milkier, three-fourth milk and one-fourth decoction), Sulemani (Black tea), Khade Chamach ki Chai(lit. "The tea with standing spoon")(Chai that purportedly has so much sugar that it'll make a spoon kept in stand up), Cutting Chai(Stronger and smaller serving).

Stand outside Nimrah, sip some Chai and take in the beauty of the heritage structures around - [Charminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charminar){:target="_blank"}, [Unani Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Nizamia_General_Hospital){:target="_blank"} and the [Mecca Masjid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makkah_Masjid,_Hyderabad){:target="_blank"}.

Sneak out the Naan you got packed from Munshi Naan and eat it with the Paya. While Rumaan offers Naan too, nothing beats Munshi Naan.

Just around the corner, you'll find [Chowmahalla Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowmahalla_Palace){:target="_blank"}(from chār mahallāt, lit. "four palaces" in Dakhni).

*A box of Jauzi Halwa from Hameedi*

On the way back to the city, Visit Hameedi Confectioners which is situated just opposite the Mozamjahi market. Hameedi Confectioners began as only a stall in 1913, when a 15-year-old Turkish boy, Muhammed Hussain, started selling sweets. His special dish, the Jouzi Halwa(from. Jauz/nutmeg) was such a hit among people that the seventh Nizam heard of it and visited the store to try it out. He loved the halwa to such an extent that he sent a letter with the royal seal to Hussain praising his sweets (Even today, this letter is on display at the store).The Nizam loved the sweet so much that he announced that the shop be named after his brother-in-law, King Abdul Hamid of turkey(accounts vary, some say it's named after his son's nickname). The sweet shop sells turkish dishes, one such dish being the special Jauzi Halwa. The Ashrafi sweet here is worth trying too. They sell a quintal of the Halwa every day.

- If the pandemic is still on by the time you travel, wear a mask and don't go on weekends to avoid crowds.
- A lot of the food stalls have dopplegangers on maps masquerading with the same name. Check if the general locality that mentioned matches.
- Be observant of the customs and rules at places of worship
